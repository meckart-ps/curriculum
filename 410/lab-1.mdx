# Lab: Interactive Accessibility Lesson

## Introduction

In this lab, you will explore the key principles of accessible web design using an interactive lesson from Scrimba. Accessibility ensures that your web applications are usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities. The principles and techniques covered in this lab will help you create inclusive web experiences.

---

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will have demonstrated your ability to:
- Apply semantic HTML to improve accessibility.
- Use ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility for screen readers.
- Ensure proper color contrast and text readability.
- Design forms and interactive elements with accessibility in mind.

## Instructions

Access the **Scrimba Learn Accessible Web Design Course** using the link below. This course covers essential topics, including:
- Understanding web accessibility and its importance.
- Using semantic HTML to make content more understandable.
- Ensuring that color contrast meets accessibility standards.
- Adding alternative text to images.
- Using ARIA roles and attributes to improve navigation and interaction.

## Review: Accessibility Enhancements Checklist

1. **Semantic HTML**: Ensure that all elements have semantic meaning. Replace `<div>` and `<span>` tags where appropriate with semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>`.

2. **ARIA Roles and Attributes**:
   - Use ARIA attributes to improve accessibility for screen readers.
   - For example, use `role="navigation"` for navigation menus or `aria-live="polite"` for dynamically updated content.

3. **Color Contrast**:
   - Check and adjust the color contrast to ensure text is readable against the background.
   - Use tools like the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to validate color contrast ratios.

4. **Alternative Text for Images**:
   - Add meaningful `alt` attributes to all images. If an image is decorative, use `alt=""` to hide it from screen readers.

5. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Ensure all interactive elements (like buttons and links) are accessible using the keyboard.
   - Use the `:focus` pseudo-class to provide visual feedback when elements are focused.

6. **Accessible Forms**:
   - Add `label` elements to form controls and associate them using the `for` attribute.
   - Use `aria-describedby` for additional instructions or error messages.

## Reflection Questions

1. What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?
2. How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?
3. What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?

## Submission

Once you have completed the course:
1. Review the code from your Scrimba challenges to ensure all accessibility enhancements have been applied.
2. Submit your "Final Challenge" code and the answers to your reflection questions on Canvas via a GitHub repository.
