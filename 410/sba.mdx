# Skills-Based Assessment (SBA): Building a Responsive and Accessible Web Page

## Overview

For this Skills-Based Assessment, you will demonstrate your ability to create a well-structured, responsive, and accessible web page using the HTML and CSS techniques you have learned. You will be assessed on your use of semantic HTML, CSS layout techniques (including Flexbox and Grid), and the implementation of accessibility features.

## Time Allotment

- **Time:** 3 hours

---

## Project Requirements

You will design and develop a responsive, multi-section webpage for a fictitious company called **Accessible Design Co.**. Your webpage should meet the following criteria:

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure

- Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.) to create a clear and meaningful structure.
- Ensure that all content is organized hierarchically using proper headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).
  
### 2. Responsive Design Using Flexbox and Grid

- Implement a **responsive navigation bar** using Flexbox that adjusts to smaller screen sizes.
- Use CSS **Grid** to create a multi-column layout for the main content area that collapses to a single column on mobile devices.
- Add media queries to adjust the layout and font sizes for different screen sizes (e.g., 600px and 1024px breakpoints).

### 3. Accessibility Features

- Use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of interactive elements:
  - Add `role="navigation"` to the navigation bar.
  - Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for labeling interactive elements where necessary.
  - Include `aria-live` attributes for dynamically updating content, if applicable.
- Ensure that all images have meaningful `alt` text, and decorative images use `alt=""`.
- Design forms with accessible labels and validation feedback:
  - Use `<label>` elements associated with each form input.
  - Add `aria-describedby` for additional instructions or error messages.
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation and focus management for all interactive elements.
  
### 4. Color Contrast and Visual Design

- Ensure text has a sufficient contrast ratio against the background (use tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)).
- Use CSS to style focus states for interactive elements (e.g., links and buttons) to make them visible when navigated with a keyboard.

## Project Description and Example Content

### Header Section
- A company logo (use a placeholder image) and a responsive navigation bar with links to "Home," "About Us," "Services," and "Contact."

### Main Content
- **Hero Section**: A large, welcoming section with a background image, an attention-grabbing heading, and a call-to-action button.
- **About Us Section**: A brief description of the company, organized using semantic tags.
- **Services Section**: A grid-based layout that showcases different services the company offers, with icons or images and short descriptions.
- **Contact Form**: A form for users to get in touch, including fields for "Name," "Email," "Subject," and "Message," with accessible labels and ARIA attributes.

### Footer Section
- A footer with copyright information, social media links, and contact details.

| **HTML Structure and Semantics** | Comprehensive use of semantic HTML; all elements are properly structured, and the hierarchy is clear and meaningful.         | Semantic HTML is used effectively with minor structural issues or missed opportunities for improvement. | Basic use of semantic HTML; structure is mostly clear but could be improved.             | Minimal or incorrect use of semantic HTML; structure is unclear or elements are misused. | \_\_ / 5 |
| **CSS Layout and Responsiveness** | Effective and advanced use of Flexbox and Grid; layout is fully responsive and visually appealing across all screen sizes.   | Adequate use of Flexbox and Grid; layout is mostly responsive with minor visual or structural issues.   | Basic use of Flexbox and Grid; layout is somewhat responsive but lacks polish.           | Minimal or incorrect use of Flexbox and Grid; layout is not responsive or visually inconsistent. | \_\_ / 5 |
| **Accessibility**            | Comprehensive implementation of accessibility features, including ARIA roles, proper labels, and keyboard navigation.       | Accessibility features are adequately implemented; minor issues or missed enhancements.                | Basic accessibility features present; room for improvement in ARIA usage or navigation.  | Minimal or incorrect accessibility features; significant usability issues for users with disabilities. | \_\_ / 5 |
| **Color Contrast and Visual Design** | Excellent color contrast and visual design; text is easily readable, and focus states are well-defined and visually appealing. | Good color contrast and visual design; minor issues with readability or focus states.                  | Basic color contrast and design; some text may be difficult to read or lacks clear focus states. | Poor color contrast or visual design; text is hard to read, and focus states are missing or ineffective. | \_\_ / 5 |
